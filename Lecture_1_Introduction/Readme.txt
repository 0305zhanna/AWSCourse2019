6. Global Infrastructure: Region (physical location with DC) -> Availability Zone (autonomous)
 - new AZ is opedned - not all service become available
 
7. AWS attribute and advantegeous:
  - IAAS vs Mictosoft and Google as PAAS
  - Migration is easier to AWS from Data Center (Premise, insfristructure)
  - Scalability
  - Costs
  - Time to Market (deployment)
  - High Availability
  
  History of AWS
   - Sell services to others
   - Build over services
  
8. Service Model, Pyramid

 - Cloud Formation infrastructure
 - VPC deploy to, copy premise infrastructure
 - IAM - security, risks (for users, policies), network securiry: Security Groups (IP level)
 - S3 - object storage, pay (simple storage service)
