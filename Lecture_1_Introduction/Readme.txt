1-2. Intro and what the course is about
3. Myself, say about the format of lectures (Theory + Practice)
   Tools and instrument 
 - Communication via Skype Group
 - Git Hub, Fork, Merge
 - AWS Console, mail, Free Tier
 - Home Tasks (2,3 practice + Theory quizz)
4. Cloud Computing Provider
 - Provider, On Premise, Migration, New Projects
 Cloud Provider definition (AWS, Azure, Google), NIST institute:
 Cloud Computing: Resources with 5 chraracteristics
  - On-demand self-service resources provided
  - Network - access to Internet and devices From/To
  - Resources pool, AWS, clients, Pay, Logical, not physical
  - (scaling RESOURCE)
  - Measured resource, pay as you go
5. Elasticity, Pay as you go -> Service-less, lambda -> milliseconds
6. Global Infrastructure: Region (physical location with DC) -> Availability Zone (autonomous)
 - new AZ is opedned - not all service become available
 
7. AWS attribute and advantegeous:
  - IAAS vs Mictosoft and Google as PAAS
  - Migration is easier to AWS from Data Center (Premise, insfristructure)
  - Scalability
  - Costs
  - Time to Market (deployment)
  - High Availability
  
  History of AWS
   - Sell services to others
   - Build over services
  
8-12. Service Model, Pyramid
8. Users(left) and Application vendors and providers(right). (horizontally)
 - targets which users
 - IAAS - more resources and API, complex management, devops
 - PAAS - more restrictions, artifactory deploy
 - SAAS - ready solution
9. Hierarchy: One over another
 - Configurability
 - Extension
10. Boundary, Key differences (Who manages from user's standpoint)
11. Pizza, Customer is Pizza store
12. AWS responsibility, focus

9. Verically

13. Tell 
 - EC2 - AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
 - AutoScaling Group
 - Cloud Formation infrastructure
 - VPC deploy to, copy premise infrastructure
 - IAM - security, risks (for users, policies), network securiry: Security Groups (IP level)
 - S3 - object storage, pay (simple storage service)

14. AWS SDK
15. AWS CLI api
 - demo
 - credentials
 - output formats
 

AWS Console - open in the browser
 - Registering, Pay Card, Many accounts, issues with Account aliases
 - Problem - suspended account, ticket, support
 - Budget and Billing
 
16. Home Task
